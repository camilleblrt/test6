Without tactile feedback it is very difficult to type without bottoming out every keystroke. Mechanical keyboards, however, use a switch underneath every key. Depending on the type of switch, they have a variety of response and travel times. The differences amongst them include the tactile feel and audible click each produces. Switches on a mechanical keyboard are made to last to 50-60 million keystrokes. Compared to membrane switches, which typically last around 1-10 million keystrokes. A mechanical keyboard is the only keyboard with the capability to register all keys at one time, also known as full N-Key Rollover. This is helpful for fast typists that need to hit keys in quick succession and gamers who need to mash key combos quickly. Plus, not having to bottom out with each key allows you to type faster with less energy, significantly improving typing and gaming speed.",
